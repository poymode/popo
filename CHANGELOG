-- 1.0.0
  * added popo update. this updates the manifest to respective branch and remigrates your
    manifest data

  * optparse separated

  * interactive popo now displays colors for eye candy

  * the runner is now passed to each command

  * version bump

  * a copy of ps1_functions scripts is now automatically sourced by poporc. if you're a fan of
    changing your prompt with ps1_set, then you can call this inside popo.
    remember that this will unset any PROMPT_COMMAND sourced before popo loads.
    this means that any ps1_set or PROMPT_COMMAND defined and sourced in your local RVM will be gone.
    this measure is to enforce prefixing your ps1 with the popo prompt to distinguish what world
    you are in so that you will not be in limbo.

  * ps1 functions in zsh are still not supported. sorry!

  * for those who aren't familiar or interested with ps1_functions, you may visit
    https://rvm.io/workflow/prompt/

  * for CI, since colors render as pure text, you can export popo_no_color=true to your CI server.
    this will disable the eye candy.
